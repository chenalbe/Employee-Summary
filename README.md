# Employee-Summary

As a manager
I want to generate a webpage that displays my team's basic info
so that I have quick access to emails and GitHub profiles.

This app is designed to execute as NODE CLI to gather inputs for the team. By answering questions of team size, and information for each team member. This app is able to generate and display all team member with different information formate based on their titles.
